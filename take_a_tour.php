					FTI (Faculty of Information Technology,Polytechnic university of Tirana) is one of the best schools in Albania for students that want to study Computer Science.
					


          </p>
          <p>
				What makes it so successful is a combination of a professional academic staff and self motivated students selected through a strict set of criteria. FTI considers the interaction between students and professors as a key factor in the process of learning,therefore <a class="evolve" href="landing_page.php">EVOLVE</a> was created.

			  <p>The main purpose of <a class="evolve" href="landing_page.php">EVOLVE</a> is to create a friendly and easily accessible comunity where students can share their work and thoughts about different school related topics. They can also find support from more experienced students or professors about various problems.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Having such a big group of students together in one platform increases collaboration between them and makes it easier to spread the word about events and job offerings. It is a platform created for students from students.
